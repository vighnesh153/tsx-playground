# How to contribute

Hello there. Looks like you are interested in contributing to [tsx-playground](https://github.com/vighnesh153/tsx-playground), which is just great, so welcome!
  
I am open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.

## Getting started

### Roadmap

Contributions via new issues are always welcomed.

### Discussion
Drop a mail to me @<a href="mailto:me@vighnesh153.com">me@vighnesh153.com</a>

## Contributing

### Coding

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo
1. Commit you code
1. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by me and I'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

#### Considerations
- Following [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) is highly encouraged
- When adding a new feature, branch from [main](https://github.com/vighnesh153/tsx-playground/tree/main)

### Documenting

Code should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.
